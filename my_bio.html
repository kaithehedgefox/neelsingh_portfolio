 <h2>Introduction</h2>

 <p>My name is Neel Pascal Singh! I'm currently 16 years old.</p>

 <h2>Backstory</h2>
 </div>
 <p>I was born on December 22, 2003 at Stanford. In 2010, when I headed towards elementary school. 
 However, I just couldn't go to public school due to me and my family's concerns about my capabilities. 
 At first, I was somewhat uneasy. I lacked the significant maturity, which was similar to that of Lennie's. But later,
 I evolved and underwent a transformation from a Lennie-type character to a coming of age. I was part of an elementary school
 class of 2015, and I graduated and advanced on to multi-class education.</p>
