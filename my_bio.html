 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 </div>
 <p>My name is Neel Pascal Singh! I'm currently 16 years old.</p>

 <h2>Backstory</h2>
 </div>
 <p>I was born on December 22, 2003 at Stanford. In 2010, when I headed towards elementary school. 
 However, I just couldn't go to public school due to me and my family's concerns about my capabilities. 
 At first, I was somewhat uneasy. I lacked the significant maturity, which was similar to that of Lennie's. But later,
 I evolved and underwent a transformation from a Lennie-type character to beginning my coming of age. I was part of an elementary school
 class of 2015, and I graduated and advanced on to multi-class education.</p>
 
 <p>When I advanced onto middle school, I was now attending public school. When I first transitioned, I was very nervous and
 unmotivated, and I couldn't make my steps. But then, after the first 2 or 3 weeks, I became confident and learned. Initally,
 I was relatively positive with no worries. However, I later began to feel anxious and uneasy. However, I graduated and
 advanced onto high-school.</p>
 
 <p>When I left middle school, and advanced on to high school, my transition wasn't that stressfull as my previous one. But I 
 evantaully got accustomed to my new schedule and went with the flow.</p>
